Multitet
========

This is an [Allegro](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/) game I wrote in 1997. I
recovered it for MacOSX Lion with little patches so my family members could
plain with it again on their fancy non-DOS machines.

No binary distribution is offered since then the [Tetris Company would come to
rape me, torture my family members, and drive over my
pets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tetris_Company#Legal_enforcement).
Therefore it's pointless to license this code under anything for reuse. Plus
tetris is not especially hard to implement.
