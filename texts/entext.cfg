bye_bye_message08 = Allegro  : Game library to help creating games made by Shawn Hargreaves.

quick_help00 = This is the quick help screen. You will have to read the 'README.TXT' file for
quick_help01 = detailed information. This help screen will tell you some basic things.
quick_help02 = \
quick_help03 = The default keys for PLAYER 1 are A and S (move), S (drop) and W (rotate)
quick_help04 = The default keys for PLAYER 2 are the arrow keys. Use them like PLAYER 1.
quick_help05 = \
quick_help06 = If you select a one player game, both the keys for PLAYER 1 and 2 can be used
quick_help07 = Use the arrow keys to move through the menus of the game and press RETURN or
quick_help08 = SPACE BAR to select an option. Use the left and right arrow keys to modify an
quick_help09 = option.
quick_help10 = \
quick_help11 = There are two modes to play TETRIS when two players are there: NORMAL MODE and
quick_help12 = DEATHMATCH MODE. When playing in NORMAL MODE, the actions of one player have no
quick_help13 = effect on what the other player is doing,but if you are playing DEATHMATCH MODE,
quick_help14 = when a player makes so many lines as the DEATH LINES value says, the 'ARENA'
quick_help15 = of the other player will GROW. Experiment with different number of DEATH LINES.
quick_help16 = The default number of DEATH LINES is set to 4, but this is quite slow. Advanced
quick_help17 = players should use 1 or 2 DEATH LINES. Then, the game is quicker and funnier.
quick_help18 = \
quick_help19 = The keys and options are stored in a file named 'CONFIG.CFG'. If you delete it,
quick_help20 = the next time you start the game, it will restore the default settings. The same
quick_help21 = applies to the high scores, which are stored in the 'SCORES.CFG' file.

quick_help23 = There are several 'HOT KEYS' which can be used in nearly every part of the game
quick_help24 = (and now don't work) and these are :
quick_help25 = \
quick_help26 = F1  : Brings you this quick help screen
quick_help27 = F5  : Decreases the sound volume of the special effects
quick_help28 = F6  : Increases the sound volume of the special effects
quick_help29 = F7  : Decreases the sound volume of the background music
quick_help30 = F8  : Increases the sound volume of the background music
quick_help31 = F10 : Saves the actual screen to a 'CAPTxxx.PCX' file.
quick_help32 = F12 : Just like F10. Why does this exist? Because I always forgot which was the
quick_help33 = \      capture screen key, and now I don't make any more mistakes ;-)
quick_help34 = \
quick_help35 = \
quick_help36 = There is also a default key (P) to pause the game, but you can redefine it. If
quick_help37 = the music bores you, press M (it is also redefineable) and it will change.
